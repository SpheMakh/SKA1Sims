In this report we study the scale dependent sensitivity of the SKA1-Mid and SKA1-SUR baseline designs. We propose
changes to the baseline design that enhance the sensitivity of SKA1-Mid at smaller angular scales (e.g. 0.4-1 arcsec at
650MHz) without compromising the performance at larger scales. The changes we propose are guided by the SKA1-Mid
level-zero science requirements \cite{srd}, which suggest that very long baselines ($>100$km) are not necessary to
achieve the SKA1-Mid science objectives. In particular, we show that a 254 dish layout with a maximum baseline of 120km,
for the specific case of an imaging survey at angular resolution 0.4-1 arcsec and in the frequency range 650-1000 MHz,
improves the SKA1-Mid survey speed by up to than 60\% and is 4 times faster than SKA-SUR as defined in the baseline
design (see Table 12) and about 60\% faster than the 2nd generation SKA-SUR (R.~Braun September 2013)\footnote{We note
that the 2nd generation configurations of R.~Braun increase the maximum baseline of SKA1-SUR from $\sim 50$~km
to $>70$~km}. The higher sensitivity on these small scales could be vital for experiments that require high sensitivity
on angular small scales, such as weak lensing and some astrobiology experiments. Furthermore, this layout spans
significantly less space which could reduce trenching and data transport costs. We also show that with a conservative
addition of 12 dishes the SKA1-Mid survey speed can be improved by up 80\% on the
smaller angular scales.

% like the project office to check both ours and their assumptions and
% ensure that this inconsistency is resolved as soon as possible.

\section{Introduction}
The SKA at mid frequencies (SKA-Mid) will be built in two phases, SKA-Mid phase one (SKA1-Mid) and phase two (SKA-Mid)
in South Africa, and SKA survey (SKA-SUR) in phase one in Australia. The key science goals for SKA phase one include the
study of the history and role of neutral hydrogen in the Universe from the dark ages to the present-day, the use of
pulsars as probes of fundamental physics \cite{bd} and continuum and H{\sc i} surveys to pin down the cosmological
model. The large emphasis on key science projects is outlined in several SKA memos, as the baseline design has emerged.
It should however be noted that changes which do not compromise the key science cases are possible and such changes
could increase the science output of SKA1-Mid.

Radio interferometers have become so complex that it has become fundamentally challenging to relate
scientific performance to design and engineering specifications, although some progress has been made (Braun
2012 \cite{rb}, Winjholds \& van der Veen 2008 \cite{wnj}). On the other hand, simulation packages such as the
\texttt{MeqTress} system (Noordam and Smirnov 2010 \cite{meqtrees}) have become sufficiently sophisticated that `brute
force' simulations of complex instruments are technically feasible. This makes it possible to approach telescope design
in an almost experimental way, using simulations to measure the impact of specific design decisions on scientific
performance (Smirnov {\it et al.} 2012, in prep.)

In this document we use a MeqTress based simulations framework to study the scale dependent sensitivity of the latest
SKA1-Mid antenna layout from the SKA project office (SPO), the so-called V8 layout. The performance of this
antenna layout is then compared to alternative layouts and the SKA-SUR 1st and 2nd generation antenna
layouts.

The rest of this document is laid out as follows: in \autoref{sec:sci-req} we discuss the science requirements for SKA1-Mid, then
in \autoref{sec:layouts} we describe the layouts that we consider. In \autoref{sec:exp} we describe our simulation
techniques and the metrics we generated from the experiment. Finally, the results and concluding remarks are in
\autoref{sec:results} and \autoref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{SKA1 Mid-frequency Baseline Design}\label{sec:BL}
The latest SKA1-Mid layout from the SPO differs significantly from the
baseline design, the biggest modifications being the moving of almost all
SKA1 dishes beyond a radius of $\sim500$m to the spiral arms, and the
shortening of the maximum baseline
from 173km to 155km. These modifications lead to better uv-coverage on
the longer baselines, and consequently a
slightly better naturally weighted point spread function (PSF).
However, due to the
core-heavy overall design of SKA1-Mid, the
PSF still retains very broad wings, which is a major issue for current
deconvolution algorithms based on {\tt CLEAN}, (Hogbom 1974),
particularly at low SNR. The PSF shape can be improved by a
combination of visibility weighting and tapering techniques, however
this comes at a cost in sensitivity. This loss in sensitivity, coupled
with the
inability to deconvolve the PSF at low SNR, will limit the dynamic
range capabilities of SKA1-Mid. Therefore, major breakthroughs in
deconvolution algorithms are required to reach the dynamic ranges
promised by SKA1's nominal sensitivity. A family of algorithms based
on compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged to tackle
deconvolution issues in the context of the SKA and its pathfinder
missions \cite{cs-ska}, in particular {\tt MORESANE} (Dabbech et al., \cite{mrs1,mrs2}) and {\tt PURIFY} (Carrillo et.
al. 2013).
Although obviously not yet as well tested as {\tt CLEAN}, these algorithms
have been shown to be superior to {\tt CLEAN} in detecting diffuse and
compact emission, especially at low SNR (Ferrari 2014, in prep \cite{ferrari}). Furthermore,
unlike {\tt CLEAN}, these algorithms do not
require a `nice' PSF. In addition to the CS-based algorithms, a
Bayesian approach to radio interferometry imaging has lead to the {\tt
RESOLVE} algorithm (Junklewitz {\it et al} 2014
\cite{resolve}), which has also been shown to produce better
results than {\tt CLEAN}. The emergence of these techniques is
particularly relevant to
SKA1-Mid since the core-heavy design is crucial for the pulsar science
goals, and attaining a Gaussian PSF needed by CLEAN with these
core-heavy layouts is a major challenge.

In light of all of this, we have decided to relax the `nice' naturally
weighted PSF requirement \footnote{Attaining a Gaussian PSF with
SKA1-Mid will require radical changes to the baseline design which may
have unforeseen financial and science output implications. The major
motivation for a Gaussian PSF is the inability of {\tt CLEAN} to
deconvolve the PSF at low SNR} and propose changes to the V8 layout
that optimise the performance at smaller angular scales, while not
significantly compromising the larger scales. We adopt naturally
weighted sensitivity per scale as our performance metric, under the
assumption that newer deconvolution algorithms will allow us to
recover that naturally weighted sensitivity.

% The mid-frequency array described in the BD is a 254 dish array with about $36\%$ of the dishes within a radius of 400m (core),
% 40\% of the dishes are between 400m and 4km (outer-core) and the remaining 24\% are in 3 three spiral arm-like structures starting
% from about 2km and stretching out to a radius of around 100km. Figures \ref{fig:lay} and \ref{fig:hist} show the BD layout and
% baseline distribution histogram ($log_{10}$ space). With about 200 fifteen metre dishes (bar the 64 13.5~metre MeerKAT dishes)
% within a radius of 4km, this array promises high sensitivity, with noise values around 63$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ hr$^{1/2}$ \cite{bd}.
% However, with three distinct dish-density regions, the resulting full sensitivity (natural weighting) point spread function (PSF)
% has two pedestals corresponding to the abrupt changes in dish densities from the core to the outer-core and from the outer-core to
% the spiral arms (see Appendix \ref{app:psf}). With such a configuration, a uv-weighting that tends towards uniform is required to
% obtain high resolution and uv-tapering might be also be required to get a well behaved PSF. Leading to significantly lower
% sensitivity due to the down-weighting of baselines\footnote{uniform uv-weighting down-weights the uv-points corresponding to
% shorter baselines, and hence gives better resolution, while a uv-taper down-weights the edges of the uv-coverage (longer
% baselines) to decrease sidelobe levels}. It is therefore important to quantify the scale-dependent sensitivity of this
% configuration, i.e., what is the sensitivity at different angular scales.
\subsection{SKA1-Mid science requirements}\label{sec:sci-req}

In this subsection we outline the scientific rationale for a change in
the baseline design, which we believe is as cost neutral as possible given the information we received from the
SKA office and which gives a direction which is different for the configuration of SKA-MID.
We have based the propositions in this document upon the assessment workshop for the
Cosmology working group where extensive discussion have taken place with the pulsar and
transient senior scientists, along with direct communication with the
Continuum Science SWG, plus several informal discussions between the Cosmology
members and the HI/continuum members.

\subsubsection{Highlights of requirements of each science area}

{\bf Pulsar science}: The pulsar search science is mainly dependent on
the core of SKA-MID. One of the key factors being the instantaneous sensitivity which depends on the number of antennas
in the core. During the discussions in the SWG, it was our understanding that a 10\%decrease in collecting are would be
an acceptable perturbation in the overall pulsar search. It is advantageous to remove the dishes from the edges of the
core as this would result in a wider synthesised beam. We also note that the Pulsar SWG requires the full sensitivity of
SKA-MID for accurate timing of the pulsars discovered in the survey.

\smallskip
\noindent{\bf Cosmology}: In what concerns the baseline distribution in this document we have four
aspects which we would like to highlight: Cosmology with continuum and
H{\sc i} galaxy surveys, weak
gravitational lensing and intensity mapping.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Cosmology with HI surveys}: The key requirement for H{\sc i}
surveys for cosmology is to have a large
survey speed coupled with baselines which do not resolve out the flux of the galaxies being
observed. Given the sizes of galaxies and the fact that we would like a significant amount of
the flux not to be resolved out, the baselines of most interest are baselines below around
5km. Hence an outer core is the most important aspect of a telescope for such science.
However losing a small amount of sensitivity compared to the baseline design in this region
of uv space is not critical and was discussed at the Cosmology science
assessment workshop, and in fact we find that we do not lose any
sensitivity in this regime for out preferred configuration. 

\item {\bf Cosmology with weak lensing}: Here the main aspect is a high sensitivity at scales which can
measure the structure and shape of the galaxies in continuum. Given the size of galaxies,
this requires significant sensitivity at scales which correspond to
0.5 to 1 arcsec. The current baseline design has a natural sensitivity
very close to the JVLA at the scales of interest, something that will
only damage the scientific reputation of the SKA. 
For these reasons having a larger number of antennas in the spiral arms out to around 70-80
km is beneficial for this science and the lack of those baselines would simply make such a
survey unfeasible. Such studies also have to be done with SKA-MID as SKA-SUR does not have
enough antennas on the longer baselines (and does not have a long
enough maximum baseline) to produce reliable maps for weak
lensing. Furthermore,  the number of UV tracks is much lower than
SKA-MID providing a poorer sampling of the spatial frequencies of
interest. %This is intrinsically due to the fact that the survey speed for SKA-SUR is coming from
%PAFs and not from extra collecting area.

\item {\bf HI and continuum morphologies}: In the current baseline design there is a lack of sensitivity
in the baselines which one would need to study morphologies of the detected continuum
and HI galaxies. The baselines needed for morphological studies of galaxies
are similar to the baselines needed for the weak lensing experiment, and therefore should be advantageous for galaxy
evolution studies which are central to the goals of the H{\sc i} and
Continuum SWGs.

\item {\bf Cosmology with intensity mapping surveys}: Intensity mapping requires very short baselines
and would benefit from having several clusters of antennas placed either in the core or in
the outer core. This arrangement is not incompatible with the configuration
proposed here and is briefly discussed below.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{General rationale}

{\bf Cost Neutral proposal}: We propose here a baseline change outlined in this document. The scientific rationale is that
baselines larger than $\sim 80-90$km are expensive given that the signal needs significant boosting to
reach the main correlator, and the extra trenching and the key fact
that none of the main science goals are directly
affected by a modest reduction of the maximum baseline (the 
science case that we believe to have the most stringent requirement
for high resolution is the 40mas at $\nu\sim 14$GHz for the Cradle of Life). 
% This cost saving should allow for
% extra antennas to be placed in the spiral arms. A cost saving along
% these lines may allow for extra antennas, and we provide information
% for an SKA1-Mid configuration with an additional 12 antennas as an
% example of the increase in sensitivity/survey speed. 

We also note here that we have assumed an approximate cost neutrality
for the SKA-Mid in isolation. If we were to consider a solution where the whole of the
mid-frequency SKA1 as cost neutral (i.e. not interfering with
SKA-Low baseline costing) then a significant number of additional dishes could be distributed
within our proposed configurations which would substantially increase the imaging
capability, the survey speed and the sheer volume of science that
could be carried out with the SKA at mid-frequencies, but which could
not be carried out with a separate site solution for the mid-frequency SKA. We
assume such studies will be incorporated into the new science case for
the SKA, but do not consider them here.

{\bf A proposal that should be encompassing of all science cases}: The rationale that the array
has significant UV coverage all the way up to ~70-80 km baselines to cover the above
science cases. This arrangement is very beneficial for HI and continuum morphological studies,
furthermore it produces a survey speed which allows weak lensing experiments to be
possible with SKA-1. We believe that it does not strongly affect HI and pulsar science as a whole and allows for
better imaging capabilities with SKA-MID. This would be greatly beneficial for the project
compared to the baseline design. Furthermore we suggest that several clusters of around 6
antennas, depending on the exact masking of roads/environments, be placed in the core/outer
core as to increase the sensitivity for intensity mapping. We do not
investigate this here as we believe it will only cause a minor perturbation in
the survey speed and sensitivities that we discuss.

\subsubsection{Specific layout implementation:}
The level-zero scientific requirements for SKA1\cite{srd} published by the SKA project office in March 2014
suggest that (at least for SKA1-Mid), an array with a maximum baseline of around ~100km is required. Therefore, we seek
a layout with the shortest possible maximum baseline that does at least as well as the V8 baseline design in the
resolution range 0.4-1 arcsec over 650, 800 and 1000MHz while not significantly compromising the performance at the
larger angular scales. Moreover, as stated previously, having a layout which performs just as well as (or better) than
the baseline layout but which covers significantly less space translates to a reduction in trenching and data transport
costs, which presents an opportunity to re-invest the funds somewhere else, therefore we consider the conservative
addition of 12 dishes. However, we note that improvements on the scales of interest are still possible without these 12
additional dishes. Furthermore, having more a better uv-coverage further out decreases loss in sensitivity for
non-natural weighting schemes. We note that shifting the dishes along the arms to get more sensitivity at small angular
scales will affect the sensitivity at larger scales (see Tables \ref{tab:noise50-new}-\ref{tab:speed_avg-new} for scale
dependent noise statics), we therefore encourage input from the SWG in search for an optimal solution. In the next
section we present two alternative layouts, these layouts have maximum baselines of 120km. The scale dependent
sensitivity of these layouts is compared to the SKA1-Mid and SKA-SUR baseline layouts in section \ref{sec:exp}.

\subsection{Background on Layouts}\label{sec:layouts}
The following SKA1-Mid layouts are under consideration here:
\begin{description}
\item[{\bf V8B155}] This is the V8 layout (254 dishes) released by the SPO (May 2014). This layout
has a maximum baseline of 155km.
\item[{\bf W8-$i$C$j$B$l$}] This is the V8 layout with $i$ dishes added
to the spiral arms and $j$ dishes moved the core to spiral arms. The spacing in the arms is then optimised  to get
more sensitivity on the longer ($>50$km) baselines (See baseline distribution histograms in Figure \ref{fig:hist} ).
This layout has maximum baseline length of $l$ kilometres.
\item {\bf SUR} The SKA survey layout (96 dishes) released by the SPO (March 2013). This layout
has maximum baseline of 50km. 
\item {\bf SUR75} This is an unofficial SKA survey layout (96 dishes) produced by Robert Braun
(September 2013). This forms the basis of the SKA Imaging Performance Memo \cite{srd}. This layout has a maximum
baseline of 75km.
\end{description}
The details of the layouts are tabulated in Table \ref{fig:lay}, and Figure \ref{fig:lay} shows the layouts while Figure
\ref{fig:hist} shows the baseline distribution histograms. Figure \ref{fig:uvcov} shows the uv-coverage
for the different layouts at 1GHz for declinations -50,-30,-10  degrees and for 8hr tracks. At this point some
optimisation has been done on the antenna distributions but we emphasise that further improvements can be and should be
made.

\section{The Experiment}\label{sec:exp}
Our aim is to investigate the scale-dependent sensitivity of the layouts described in the previous section.
We use the \texttt{makems} tool to make simulated measurement sets (MS) of 8hr tracks with a 60s integration time for
declinations -50, -30 and -10 degrees, at frequencies of 650, 800 and 1000MHz, with a single 50MHz channel. The expected rms noise
per real and imaginary part for each visibility is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{vis}} = \frac{\text{SEFD}}{\sqrt{2\Delta t\Delta \nu}}.
\end{equation}
We use the baseline design's SEFD values for the SKA and legacy dishes. The noise for visibilities corresponding to baselines
between SKA and legacy dishes is calculated using $\text{SEFD}_{\text{MIX}}=\sqrt{\text{SEFD}_{\text{SKA}} \times
\text{SEFD}_{\text{LEGACY}}}$. The MS is then filled with random Gaussian noise using the computed value of the noise for a
given integration and bandwidth. We then use the (CASA-derived) \texttt{lwimager} tool to make dirty maps of
the PSF as well as dirty maps of the noise using various weighting and tapering schemes. Note that for uniform and
robust weighting, a crucial parameter is the size of the uv-bin over which weights are “uniformized”. By default this is
determined from the full image size, but \texttt{lwimager} allows one to uniformize the weights over bins corresponding
to a user-defined FoV instead. For these simulations uv-bins corresponding to a FoV of 10 arcmin were used.. The
following metrics were generated:
\begin{itemize}
 \item PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) size (mean of the FWHM dimensions). This was measured by making high-resolution
images of the PSF (0.05 arcsec resolution), and fitting a Gaussian to the PSF (Table \ref{tab:psf_mean-dec30}). A
catalog
of PSF
cross-sections (full uv-coverage) is provided in Appendix \ref{app:psf}.

 \item PSF symmetry (PSF size parameters are obtained as explained above). As a measure of PSF symmetry, we define 
$\text{PSF}_{sym}=1-\text{FWHM}_{min}/\text{FWHM}_{maj}$, then $\text{PSF}_{sym} = 0$ is perfect symmetry, and the symmetry
degenerates as $\text{PSF}_{sym}\,\,\, \rightarrow\,\,1$ (Table \ref{tab:psf_sym-dec30}).

 \item RMS pixel noise at different angular scales for 50kHz, 50MHz and 166MHz wide bands (Tables
\ref{tab:noise50k-dec30} -
\ref{tab:noise166-dec30}).

\item RMS PSF far sidelobe level. These were measured by making images of the PSF 1 degree across, and measuring
the rms levels beyond a radius of 30 arcmin.

 \item SNR for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1000MHz with a spectral index of -0.7 after 8hrs for a 166MHz band (Table
\ref{tab:snr10-dec30}).
 
 \item Average SNR over frequencies 650, 800 and 1000MHz (166MHz band) after 8 hours, for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1000MHz
with a
spectral index of -0.7. {$\overline{\text{SNR10}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(\text{SNR10}_{650}^2 + \text{SNR10}_{800}^2
+\text{SNR10}_{1000}^2})$} (Table \ref{tab:snravg-dec30}).

 \item Hours required to reach a mean SNR of 10 (Table \ref{tab:hours-dec30}).
 
 \item Survey Speed. These values are calculated using the FOV values in the SRD (band 1 for SKA1-Mid and band 2 PAF FOV
for
SKASUR) and the values in Table \ref{tab:snr10-dec30}. Note that unlike the SKASUR FOV, the SKA1-Mid FOV changes across
the band
(FOV$_{\text{Mid}}\sim \nu^{-2}$). $\text{SS}_\text{Freq} = \text{FOV}_\text{Freq}\times \text{SNR}^2$. 
% We consider band 1 for SKA-Mid and band 2 for SKASUR. 
 \item Average survey speed. {$\overline{\text{SS}} =\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}(\text{SS}_{650}^2 + \text{SS}_{800}^2
+\text{SS}_{1000}^2})$} (Table \ref{tab:speed_avg-dec30}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Simulation Results}\label{sec:results}
\subsection{PSF and Noise Statistics}
% In appendix \ref{sec:band5} the above mentioned metrics are presented for a 2.5GHz band at 8, 12 and 13.8GHz, at a
% declination of -30 degrees.
Figure \ref{fig:full-psf_meam} shows the PSF sizes (FWHM) for the layouts under consideration as a function of frequency
for natural and robust-2 weighting as well as robust-2 weighting  with a 1$''$ Gaussian taper at a declination of -30
degrees. Note that for natural weighting the PSF is highly non-Gaussian (see appendix \ref{app:psf}) therefore the FWHM
size is not representative of the PSF size. The PSF sizes for the SKA1-Mid layouts are similar for the other two
weighting schemes, while unsurprisingly, the SUR75 has a significantly smaller PSF compared to SUR. In the case for
SKA1-Mid, this shows that a 120km maximum baseline layout has very similar resolving performance compared to a 150km
maximum baseline layout.

\subsection{Scale dependent PSF and Noise Statistics}
In this section we only present the scale dependent PSF and noise statics at declination -30 degrees, statics for
declinations -10 and -50 can be found in Appendix \ref{app:all_decs}. These metrics are generated at different angular
scales, this is done by applying an inner-taper\footnote{The weights for the taper are generated using a Butterworth
function.} to taper out baselines that do not fall within a given resolution range, i.e., we only consider uv-points
that correspond to a given resolution. A table showing which resolution ranges belong to the different resolution bins
is included on each page to facilitate the reading of the tables in this section.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
The metrics we have used suggest that the science goals (at least those listed in the SRD in addition to cosmology with weak
lensing and H{\sc i} surveys) can be met by a layout which covers significantly less space compared to the baseline layout. The
SKA1W8-0C0B120 layout performs significantly better at smaller angular scales, $>$ 20\% improvement in terms of the
noise properties and a 60\% improvement in survey speed, without compromising the larger scales. Moreover, the SKA1-Mid
performance can be further enhanced by adding a handful of dishes in the spiral arms as can be seen with the 
SKA1W8-12C0B120 layout.

Bringing in the dishes from the longer baselines translates to a greater sensitivity on the relevant (to the
science goals of SKA1-Mid) smaller scales, as can be seen in Tables \ref{tab:noise50k-dec30}-\ref{tab:hours-dec30}. Even
more encouraging is the fact that this doesn't compromise the size or the symmetry of the PSF as seen in Tables
\ref{tab:psf_mean-dec30} and \ref{tab:psf_sym-dec30}, as well as in Appendix \ref{app:psf}.  In comparison to the
SKA-SUR baseline design configurations we find that all SKA-Mid configurations significantly out perform SKA-SUR in
terms of sensitivity and survey speed. Even with the 2nd generation SKA-SUR configuration with longer baselines, our
proposed SKA1-Mid configuration still outperforms SKA-SUR in terms of survey speed by a factor of
$\sim 1.6$. {\bf We proffer the SKA1W8-0C0B120 configuration as a solution which allows for weak lensing, H{\sc i}
and continuum source morphology characterisation for galaxy evolution studies, as well as the other science cases detailed in the
SRD. Although we note that such a configuration also needs to be analysed by other SWGs, in particular the H{\sc i}
SWG.}

In light of this, we request that the project office analyses the
numbers used for the various figures in the various documentation
purporting to the relative sensitivities and survey speeds for
SKA1-Mid and SKA-SUR.
