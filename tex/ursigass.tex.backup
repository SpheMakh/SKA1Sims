\begin{abstract}
In this report we study the scale dependent sensitivity of the SKA1-Mid baseline design. We also propose changes to the baseline
design that enhance the sensitivity at smaller angular scales (e.g. 0.4-1 arcsec at 650MHz) without compromising the performance
at
larger scales. The changes we propose are guided by the SKA1-Mid level-zero science requirements \cite{srd}, which suggest that
very long baselines ($>150$km) are not necessary to achieve the SKA1-Mid science objectives. The layouts we propose could be
transformational for other potential science cases which are possible with such an instrument, such as cosmology with weak
lensing, at no significant cost to any of the key science cases. In particular, a layout which has a maximum baseline of 120km
(SKA1X9-12A72B120) has more than twice the survey speed of the ``second generation'' baseline layout at angular resolutions of
around 0.4-1 arcsec (over 650-1100MHz). Furthermore, such a layout spans significantly less space which could potentially reduce
trenching and data transport costs.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-.1cm}
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is meant to be an international facility that will provide as much science as possible
during its lifetime. The large emphasis on key science projects is outlined in several SKA memos, as the baseline design has
emerged. It should however be noted that changes which do not compromise the key science cases are possible and such changes could
be transformational for other science cases. In this short report, we compare the scale-dependent sensitivity of the SKA1-Mid
baseline design to 4 alternative designs. The alternative layouts we propose are guided by the SKA1-Mid general science
requirements outlined in the SKA1 Level-zero requirements document \cite{srd}, and the possibility of having better imaging
quality with SKA-Mid. Essentially, looking that at the SKA1-Mid science requirements \cite{srd}, it is clear that baselines longer
than about 100km are not a necessity. We therefore seek a layout with the shortest possible maximum baseline that does at least as
well as the ``second generation'' baseline design in the resolution range 0.4-1 arcsec over 650, 800 and 1100MHz\footnote{This
well covers the highest resolution requirements in the level-zero science requirements} while not significantly compromising the
performance at the larger angular scales. Moreover, having a layout which performs just as well as (or better) than the baseline
layout but which covers significantly less space translates to less trenching, which may present the opportunity to re-invest the
funds somewhere else, therefore we consider the conservative addition of 12 dishes. However, we note that improvements on the
scales of interest are still possible without these 12 additional dishes. In the next section we present 4 alternative layouts
with maximum baselines of 90, 100, 120 and 133 km. The scale dependent sensitivity of these layouts is compared to the
baseline layout in section \ref{sec:exp}, and our conclusions are presented in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{Background on Layouts}\label{sec:layouts}
\vspace{-.1cm}
The following SKA1-Mid layouts are under consideration here:
\begin{description}
\item[{\bf REF2A100B173 :}] This is the ”Second-generation” layout (254 dishes) produced by Robert Braun (September
2013)\footnote{We assume this to be the baseline layout.}. The spiral arms of this layout stretch out to ~100km, and the maximum
baseline is 173km. In this report, we also refer to this layout as REF2. \item[{\bf X$i$-$j$A$k$B$l$ :}] This is the REF2 layout
with the core (within a 400m radial distance from the the centre) ``puffed up'' by 10\%, $i$ dishes moved from the outer core
(between a radial distance of 0.4 and 4km from the centre) to the spiral arms and $j$ extra dishes added to the spiral arms. The
spacing in the arms is then optimised to get more sensitivity on the longer ($>50$km) baselines (See baseline distribution
histograms in Figure \ref{fig:hist} ). Each spiral arm stretches out to ~$k$ kilometres and the maximum baseline length is about
$l$ kilometres.
\end{description}
The  layouts are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lay}, while Figure \ref{fig:hist} shows the baseline distribution histogram for the
different layouts. Figure \ref{fig:uvcov} shows the uv-coverage for the different layouts at 1.1GHz at declination -30 degrees for
8hr tracks. At this point some optimisations have been done on the antenna distributions but we emphasise that further
improvements can be and should be made.

\section{The Experiment}\label{sec:exp}
\vspace{-.2cm}
Our aim is to investigate the scale-dependent sensitivity of the layouts described in the previous section. We use the
\texttt{makems} tool to make simulated measurement sets of 8hr tracks with a 60s integration time at declination -30$^\circ$ at
frequencies of \{650, 800, 1100\}MHz with a single channel. The expected rms noise per real and imaginary part for each visibility
is calculated as $\sigma_{\text{vis}} = \text{SEFD}/\sqrt{2\Delta t\Delta \nu}$. We use the baseline design's system
equivalent flux density (SEFD) value of 400 corresponding to the 15m dishes. We then fill the measurement set with random
Gaussian noise using the computed value of the noise for a given integration and bandwidth. We then use the (CASA-derived)
\texttt{lwimager} tool to make maps of the point spread function (PSF) as well as dirty maps of the noise. The following metrics
were generated:\\ {\bf Note:} These metrics are generated at different angular scales, this is done by tapering\footnote{The
weights for the taper are generated using a Butterworth function } visibilities that don not fall within a given uv-distance
range, i.e., we only consider uv-points that correspond to a given resolution.             
                                                                   
\begin{itemize}
 \item PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) size (mean of the FWHM dimensions). This was measured by making high-resolution
images of the PSF (0.05 arcsec resolution), and fitting a Gaussian to the PSF. Note that for the highly non-Gaussian PSFs
corresponding to natural and (some) robust weighting schemes, the fit is very poor, so the size parameter becomes somewhat
ill-defined (Table \ref{tab:psf_mean}).
 \item PSF symmetry (PSF size parameters are obtained as explained above). As a measure of PSF symmetry, we define 
$\text{PSF}_{sym}=1-\text{FWHM}_{min}/\text{FWHM}_{maj}$, then $\text{PSF}_{sym} = 0$ is perfect symmetry, and the symmetry
degenerates as $\text{PSF}_{sym}\,\,\, \rightarrow\,\,1$ (Table \ref{tab:psf_sym}).

 \item RMS pixel noise at different angular scales for a 166MHz wide band (Table \ref{tab:noise166}).
 
 \item SNR for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz with a spectral index of -0.7 after 8hrs for a 166MHz band (Table \ref{tab:snr10}).
 \item Average SNR over frequencies 650, 800 and 1100MHz (166MHz band)
   after 8 hours, for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz
with a spectral index of -0.7 (Table \ref{tab:snravg}). {$\overline{SNR10}=\sqrt{SNR10_{650}^2 + SNR10_{800}^2 +
SNR10_{1100}^2}$}.
 \item Hours required to reach a mean SNR of 10 (Table \ref{tab:hours}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
\vspace{-.1cm}
The metrics we have used suggest that the science goals (at least
those listed in the SRD in addition to cosmology with weak lensing and
H{\sc i} surveys) can be met by a layout which
covers significantly less space compared to the baseline layout. Some
of these ``smaller'' layouts perform significantly better than the
baseline layout at smaller scales, up to a 50\% improvement in terms of the noise properties, without compromising the larger
scales. This obviously presents an opportunity to reduce trenching and data transport costs. Moreover, bringing in the dishes
from the longer baselines translates to a greater sensitivity on the relevant (to the science goals of SKA1-Mid) smaller scales,
as can be seen
in Tables \ref{tab:noise166}-\ref{tab:hours}. Even more encouraging is the fact that this doesn't compromise the size or the
symmetry of the PSF as seen in Tables \ref{tab:psf_mean} and
\ref{tab:psf_sym}. {\bf Our preferred solution which allows for weak
  lensing, H{\sc i} and continuum source morphology characterisation for galaxy
  evolution studies is the SKA1X9-12A72B120 configuration}. Although
we note that we have not optimised around this solution and such a
configuration also needs to be analysed by SKA science working groups, in particular
the H{\sc i} science working group.
