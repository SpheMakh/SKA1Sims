\begin{abstract}
 In this report we study the scale dependent sensitivity of the SKA-Mid baseline design. We also propose changes to the baseline
design that enhance the sensitivity at smaller scales (say 0.4-1 arcsec at 650MHz) while not compromising the performance at
larger scales. The changes we propose are guided by the SKA1-Mid level-zero science requirements \cite{srd} which suggest that
baselines larger than 100km are not necessary to achieve the SKA1-Mid science objectives. Furthermore, some of our layouts cover
significantly less space which could potentially reduce trenching and data transport costs.

\section{Introduction}
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is meant to be an international facility that will provide as much science as possible
during its lifetime. Although there is a large emphasis on key science projects outlined in several SKA memos, as the baseline
design has emerged, it is clear that changes which do not compromise the key science missions are possible and such changes could
be transformational for other potential science missions. In this short report, we compare the scale-dependent sensitivity of the
SKA1-Mid baseline design to 4 alternate designs. The alternate layouts we propose are guided by the SKA1-Mid general science
requirements outlined in the SKA1 Level-zero requirements document \cite{srd}, and the possibility of having better imaging
quality with SKA-Mid. Essentially, looking that at the SKA1-Mid science requirements \cite{srd}, it is clear that baselines
longer than about 100km are not a necessity. We therefore seek a layout with the shortest possible maximum baseline that does at
least as well as the ``second generation'' baseline design in the resolution range 0.4-1 arcsec over 650, 800 and
1100MHz\footnote{This well covers the highest resolution requirements in the level-zero science requirements} while not
significantly compromising the performance at the larger angular scales. Moreover, having a layout which performs just as well as
(or better) than the baseline layout but which covers significantly less space translates to less trenching, which may present the
opportunity to re-invest the funds somewhere else, therefore we consider the conservative addition of 12 dishes. However, we note
that improvements on the scales of interest are still possible without these 12 additional dishes. In the next section we present
4 alternate layouts, these layouts have maximum baselines of 90,100,120 and 133 km. The scale dependent sensitivity of these
layouts is compared to the baseline layout in section \ref{sec:exp}, and our conclusions are in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{Background on Layouts}\label{sec:layouts}
The following SKA1-Mid layouts are under consideration here:
\begin{description}
\item[{\bf REF2A100B173 :}] This is the ”Second-generation” layout (254 dishes) produced by Robert Braun (September
2013)\footnote{We assume this to be the baseline layout.}. The spiral arms of this layout stretch out to ~100km, and the maximum
baseline is 173km. We also refer to this layout as REF2. 
\item[{\bf X$i$-$j$A$k$B$l$ :}] This is the REF2 layout with the core ``puffed up'' by 10\%, with $i$ dishes moved from
the outer core to the spiral arms and $j$ extra dishes added to the spiral arms. The spacing in the arms is then optimized to get
more sensitivity on the longer ($>50$km) baselines (See baseline distribution histograms in Figure \ref{fig:hist} ). Each spiral
arm stretches out to ~$k$ kilometres and the maximum baseline length is about $l$ kilometres.
\end{description}
The  layouts are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lay}, and Figure \ref{fig:hist} shows the baseline distribution histogram for the
different layouts. Figure \ref{fig:uvcov} shows the uv-coverage for the different layouts at 1.1GHz at declination -30 degrees for
8hr tracks. At this point some optimisations have been done on the antenna distributions but we emphasise that further
improvements can be and should be made.

\section{The Experiment}\label{sec:exp}
Our aim is to investigate the scale-dependent sensitivity of the layouts described in the previous section. We use the
\texttt{makems} tool make simulated measurement sets of a an 8hr track with a 60s integration time at declination -30 degrees at
frequencies of \{650, 800, 1100\}MHz with a single channel. The expected rms noise per real and imaginary part for each visibility
is calculated as $\sigma_{\text{vis}} = \text{SEFD}/\sqrt{2\Delta t\Delta \nu}$. We use the baseline designs SEFD value of 400
corresponding to the 15 m dishes. We then fill the MS with random Gaussian noise using the computed value of the noise for a given
integration and bandwidth. We then use the (CASA-derived) \texttt{lwimager} tool to make maps of the PSF, and dirty maps of the
noise using various weighting schemes. Note that for uniform and robust weighting, a crucial parameter is the size of the  uv-bin
over which weights are “uniformized”. By default this is determined from the full image size, but \texttt{lwimager} allows one to
uniformize the weights over bins corresponding to a user-defined FoV instead. For these simulations uv-bins corresponding to a
FoV of 10 arcmin were used. The following metrics were generated:\\ {\bf Note:} These metrics are generated at different angular
scales, this is done by applying an inner-taper\footnote{The weights for the taper are generated using a Butterworth function } to
taper out baselines that do not fall with a given resolution range, i.e., only considering uv-points that correspond to a given
resolution.                                                                                                     
\begin{itemize}
 \item PSF FWHM size (mean of the FWHM dimensions). This was measured by making high-resolution images of the PSF (0.05 arcsec
resolution), and fitting a Gaussian to the PSF. Note that for the highly non-Gaussian PSFs corresponding to natural and (some)
robust weighting schemes, the fit is very poor, so the size parameter becomes somewhat ill-defined (Table \ref{tab:psf_mean}).

 \item PSF symmetry (PSF size parameters are obtained as explained above). As a measure of PSF symmetry, we define 
$\text{PSF}_{sym}=1-\text{FWHM}_{min}/\text{FWHM}_{maj}$, then $\text{PSF}_{sym} = 0$ is perfect symmetry, and the symmetry
degenerates as $\text{PSF}_{sym}\,\,\, \rightarrow\,\,1$ (Table \ref{tab:psf_sym}).

 \item Rms pixel noise at different angular scales for a 166MHz wide band (Table \ref{tab:noise166}).
 
 \item SNR for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz with a spectral index of -0.7 after 8hrs for a 166MHz band (Table \ref{tab:snr10}).
 \item Average SNR over frequencies 650, 800 and 1100MHz (166MHz band)
   after 8 hours, for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz
with an spectral index of -0.7 (Table \ref{tab:snravg}). {$\overline{SNR10}=\sqrt{SNR10_{650}^2 + SNR10_{800}^2 + SNR10_{1100}^2}$}.
 \item Hours required to reach a mean SNR of 10 (Table \ref{tab:hours}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
The metrics we have used suggest that the science goals (at least those listed in the SKA1 Level-zero requirements) can be met by
a layout which covers significantly less space compared to the baseline layout. Some of these ``smaller'' layouts perform better
than the baseline layout at smaller scales, up to a 50\% improvement in terms of the noise properties, while not compromising the
larger scales. This obviously presents an opportunity to reduce trenching and data transport costs. Moreover, bringing in the
dishes further out translates to a greater sensitivity on the relevant (to the science goals of SKA1-Mid) smaller scales, as can
be seen in Tables \ref{tab:noise166}-\ref{tab:hours}. Even more encouraging is the fact that this doesn't compromise the size or
the symmetry of the PSF as seen in Tables \ref{tab:psf_mean} and \ref{tab:psf_sym}.
