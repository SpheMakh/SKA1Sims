\section{Introduction}
The SKA at mid frequencies (SKA-Mid) will be built in two distinct phases, SKA-Mid phase one (SKA1-Mid) and phase two (SKA2-Mid)
in South Africa, and SKA-SUR in phase 1 in Australia. The key science goals for SKA1-Mid include the study of the history and role
of neutral hydrogen in the Universe from the dark ages to the present-day, the use of pulsars as probes of fundamental physics
\cite{bd} and continuum and H{\sc i} surveys to pin down the cosmological model. Although there is a large emphasis on key science
projects outlined in several SKA memos, as the baseline design has emerged. It should be noted that changes which do not
compromise the key science are possible and such changes could be transformational for other sciences cases which are possible
with such an instrument. \\ In this document, we attempt to gauge the scale-dependent sensitivity of the mid-frequency array
described in the {\it SKA1 System Baseline Design} (BD) document \cite{bd}. The performance of this configuration is then compared
to four alternative configurations. We also explore different weighting and tapering schemes as a way of increasing performance.\\
The rest of this document is laid out as follows: in \autoref{sec:sci-req} we discuss the science requirements for SKA1-Mid, then
in \autoref{sec:layouts} we describe layouts that we will be considering. In \autoref{sec:exp} we describe our simulation
techniques and the metrics we generated from the experiment. Finally, the results and concluding remarks are in
\autoref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{SKA1-Mid Baseline Design}\label{sec:BL}
The mid-frequency array described in the BD is a 254 dish array with about $36\%$ of the dishes within a radius of 400m (core),
40\% of the dishes are between 400m and 4km (outer-core) with the remaining 24\% in 3 three spiral arm-like structures starting
from about 2km and stretching out to a radius around 70km. Figures \ref{fig:lay} and \ref{fig:hist} show the BD layout and
baseline distribution histogram ($log_{10}$ space). With about 200 fifteen metre dishes (bar the 64 13.5~metre MeerKAT dishes)
within a radius of 4km, this array promises high sensitivity, with noise values around 63$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ hr$^{1/2}$ \cite{bd}.
However, with three distinct dish-density regions, the resulting full sensitivity (natural weighting) point spread function (PSF)
has two pedestals corresponding to the abrupt changes in dish densities from the core to the outer-core and from the outer-core to
the spiral arms (see Appendix \ref{app:psf}). With such a configuration, a uv-weighting that tends towards uniform is required to
obtain high resolution and uv-tapering might be also be required to get a well behaved PSF. Leading to lower sensitivity due to
the down-weighting of baselines\footnote{uniform uv-weighting down-weights the uv-points corresponding to shorter baselines, and
hence gives better resolution, while a uv-taper down-weights the edges of the uv-coverage (longer baselines) to decrease sidelobe
levels}. It is therefore important to quantify the scale-dependent sensitivity of this configuration, i.e., what is the
sensitivity at different angular scales and how this sensitivity is affected by different uv-weighting and tapering schemes. 

\subsection{SKA1-Mid science requirements}\label{sec:sci-req}

In this subsection we outline the scientific rationale for a proposal for baseline change
which we believe is as cost neutral as possible given the information we received from the
SKA office and which gives a direction which is different for the configuration of SKA-MID.
We have based the propositions in this document upon the assessment workshop for the
Cosmology working group where extensive discussion have taken place with the pulsar and
transient senior scientists plus several informal discussions between the Cosmology
members and the HI/continuum members.

\subsubsection{Highlights of requirements of each science area}

{\bf Pulsar science}: the pulsar search science is mainly dependent on the core of SKA-MID. The
instantaneous sensitivity which depends on the number of antennas in the core.
Furthermore if the antennas are moved out of the core, the synthesised beam would be
reduced which increases the pulsar search time. During the discussions in the SWG, it was
our understanding that an increase of the core area of around 10\% would be a minor
perturbation in the overall pulsar search.
Cosmology: in what concerns the baseline distribution in this document we have three
aspects which we would like to highlight: Cosmology with galaxy surveys, with weak
gravitational lensing and with intensity mapping.

{\bf Cosmology with HI surveys}: Here the main aspect of the instrument is to have a large
survey speed coupled with baselines which do not resolve out the flux of the galaxies being
observed. Given the sizes of galaxies and the fact that we would like a significant amount of
the flux not to be resolved out, the baselines of most interest are baselines below around
5km. Hence an outer core is the most important aspect of a telescope for such science.
However losing a small amount of sensitivity compared to the baseline design in this region
of uv space is not critical and was discussed at the Cosmology science assessment workshop.

{\bf Cosmology with weak lensing}: Here the main aspect is a high sensitivity at scales which can
measure the structure and shape of the galaxies in continuum. Given the size of galaxies,
this requires significant sensitivity at scales which correspond to 0.5 to 1 arcsec in the sky.
For these reasons having a larger number of antennas in the spiral arms out to around 70-80
km is beneficial for this science and the lack of those baselines would simply make such a
survey unfeasible. Such studies have to be done with SKA-MID as SKA-SUR does not have
enough antennas to produce reliable maps as the number of UV tracks is much lower than
SKA-MID. This is intrinsically due to the fact that the sensitivity of SKA-SUR is coming from
paths and not from extra collecting area.

{\bf HI and continuum morphologies}: In the current baseline design there is a lack of sensitivity
in the baselines which one would need to study morphologies of the detected continuum
and HI galaxies. The current baseline design is not even an order of magnitude better than
the VLA in terms of sensitivity. The baselines needed for morphological studies of galaxies
are similar to the baselines needed for the weak lensing experiment with weak lensing.

{\bf Cosmology with intensity mapping surveys}: Intensity mapping requires very short baselines
and would benefit from having several clusters of antennas placed either in the core or in
the outer core. This arrangement is not incompatible with the broad long baseline
proposition presented here and is briefly discussed below.

\subsubsection{General rationale}

{\bf Cost Neutral proposal}: We propose here a baseline change which is outlined in this document below. The scientific rationale
is that
baselines larger than $\sim 80-90$km are expensive given that the signal needs significant boosting to
reach the main correlator, and the extra trenching and no main science goals are directly
affected by a modest reduction of the maximum baseline. This cost saving should allow for
extra antennas to be placed in the spiral arms. We have estimated (after informally enquiring
with individuals at the SKA office) this cost saving to allow for an extra 12 antennas.

{\bf A proposal that should be encompassing of all science cases}: The rational that the array
has significant UV coverage all the way up to ~70-80 km baselines to cover the above
science cases would suggest a smooth transition form the core to the outer core to the
spiral arms. This is obtained by a slight puffing up of the core as suggested it be possible by
the pulsar/transient team. The number of antennas in the core is preserved in our
proposal. This transitions to the outer core which is slightly reduced as the main science for
the outer core is the HI detection for cosmological purposes. We propose this sacrifice as
the science loss here is minimal for a loss of around 9 antennas. We further propose to
reduce the spiral arms as no science directly needs those large baselines and instead voce
the spiral arms with the extra 21 antennas which were sacrificed from the outer core (9)
plus the antennas which could be purchased from a cost effective reduction of the
maximum baseline.

This arrangement is very beneficial for HI and continuum morphological studies,
furthermore it produced a survey speed which allows weak lensing experiments to be
possible with SKA-1. It does not sacrifice HI and pulsar science as a whole and allows for
better imaging capabilities with SKA-MID. We believe that this is beneficial for the project
compared to the baseline design. Furthermore we suggest that several clusters of around 6
antennas, depending on the exact mask of roads, be placed in the core/outer
core as to increase the sensitivity for intensity mapping. This was not proposed as masking is
likely to change the position of the antennas.

\subsubsection{Specific layout implementation:}
The general scientific requirements for SKA1\cite{srd} (SRD) published by the SPO in March 2014 suggest that (at least for
SKA1-Mid), an array with a maximum baseline of around ~100km is required. Therefore, we seek a layout with the shortest possible
maximum baseline that does at least as well as the ``second generation'' baseline design in the resolution range 0.4-1 arcsec over
650, 800 and 1100MHz while not significantly compromising the performance at the larger angular scales. Moreover, as stated
previously, having a layout which performs just as well as (or better) than the baseline layout but which covers significantly
less space translates to a reduction in trenching and data transport costs, which presents an opportunity to re-invest the funds
somewhere else, therefore we consider the conservative addition of 12 dishes. However, we note that improvements on the scales of
interest are still possible without these 12 additional dishes. In the next section we present 4 alternate layouts, these layouts
have maximum baselines of 90,100,120 and 133 km. The scale dependent sensitivity of these layouts is compared to the baseline
layout in section \ref{sec:exp}.


\subsection{Background on Layouts}\label{sec:layouts}
The following SKA1-Mid layouts are under consideration here:
\begin{description}
\item[{\bf REF2A100B173 :}] This is the ”Second-generation” layout (254 dishes) produced by Robert Braun (September
2013)\footnote{We assume this to be the baseline layout.}. The spiral arms of this layout stretch out to ~100km, and the maximum
baseline is 173km. We also refere to this layout as REF2. 
\item[{\bf X$i$-$j$A$k$B$l$ :}] This is the REF2 layout with the core ``puffed up'' by 10\%, with $i$ dishes moved from
the outer core to the spiral arms and $j$ extra dishes added to the spiral arms. The spacing in the arms is then optimized to get
more sensitivity on the longer ($>50$km) baselines (See baseline distribution histograms in Figure \ref{fig:hist} ). Each spiral
arm stretches out to ~$k$ kilometres and the maximum baseline length is about $l$ kilometres.
\end{description}
The details of the layouts are tabulated in Table \ref{fig:lay}, and Figure \ref{fig:lay} shows the layouts and Figure
\ref{fig:hist} shows the baseline distribution histogram for the different layouts. Figure \ref{fig:uvcov} shows the uv-coverage
for the different layouts at 1.1GHz at declinations -50,-30,-10 degrees for 8hr tracks. At this point some optimisations have been
done on the antenna distributions but we emphasise that further improvements can be and should be made.

\end{figure}

\section{The Experiment}\label{sec:exp}
Our aim is to investigate the scale-dependent sensitivity of the layouts described in the previous section.
We use the \texttt{makems} tool to make simulated measurement sets of 8hr tracks with a 60s integration time on declinations
\{-50, -30, -10\} degrees at frequencies of \{650, 800, 1100\}MHz with a single 50MHz channel. The expected rms noise per real
and imaginary part for each visibility is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{vis}} = \frac{\text{SEFD}}{\sqrt{2\Delta t\Delta \nu}}.
\end{equation}
We use the baseline design's {\it system equivalent flux desnity} (SEFD) value of 400 corresponding to the 15 m dishes. We then
fill the measurement set with random Gaussian noise using the computed value of the noise for a given integration and bandwidth.
We then use the (CASA-derived) \texttt{lwimager} tool to make maps of the PSF as well as dirty maps of the
noise using various weighting schemes. Note that for uniform and robust weighting, a crucial parameter is the size of the uv-bin
over which weights are “uniformized”. By default this is determined from the full image size, but \texttt{lwimager} allows one to
uniformize the weights over bins corresponding to a user-defined field of view (FoV) instead. For these simulations uv-bins
corresponding to a FoV of 10 arcmin were used. The following metrics were generated:\\ {\bf Note:} These metrics are generated at
different angular scales, this is done by applying an inner-taper\footnote{The weights for the taper are generated using a
Butterworth function } to taper out baselines that do not fall within a given resolution range, i.e., we only consider uv-points
that correspond to a given resolution.
\begin{itemize}
 \item PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) size (mean of the FWHM dimensions). This was measured by making high-resolution
images of the PSF (0.05 arcsec resolution), and fitting a Gaussian to the PSF. Note that for the highly non-Gaussian PSFs
corresponding to natural and (some) robust weighting schemes, the fit is very poor, so the size parameter becomes somewhat
ill-defined (Table \ref{tab:psf_mean}).

 \item PSF symmetry (PSF size parameters are obtained as explained above). As a measure of PSF symmetry, we define 
$\text{PSF}_{sym}=1-\text{FWHM}_{min}/\text{FWHM}_{maj}$, then $\text{PSF}_{sym} = 0$ is perfect symmetry, and the symmetry
degenerates as $\text{PSF}_{sym}\,\,\, \rightarrow\,\,1$ (Table \ref{tab:psf_sym}).

 \item Rms pixel noise at different angular scales for 50 and 166MHz wide bands (Tables \ref{tab:noise50} and \ref{tab:noise166}).
 
 \item SNR for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz with a spectral index of -0.7 after 8hrs for a 166MHz band (Table \ref{tab:snr10}).
 \item Average SNR over frequencies 650, 800 and 1100MHz (166MHz band) after 8 hours, for a 10$\mu$Jy source at 1100MHz with a
spectral index of -0.7 (Table \ref{tab:snravg}). {$\overline{SNR10}=\sqrt{SNR10_{650}^2 + SNR10_{800}^2 + SNR10_{1100}^2}$}.
 \item Hours required to reach a mean SNR of 10 (Table \ref{tab:hours}).

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
The metrics we have used suggest that the science goals (at least those listed in the SRD) can be met by a  layou t which
covers significantly less space compared to the baseline layout. Some of these ``smaller'' layouts perform better than the
baseline layout at smaller scales, up to a 50\% improvement in terms of the noise properties, without compromising the larger
scales. This obviously presents an opportunity to reduce trenching and data transport costs. Moreover, bringing in the dishes
further out translates to a greater sensitivity on the relevant (to the science goals of SKA1-Mid) smaller scales, as can be seen
in Tables \ref{tab:noise50}-\ref{tab:hours}. Even more encouraging is the fact that this doesn't compromise the size or the
symmetry of the PSF as seen in Tables \ref{tab:psf_mean} and \ref{tab:psf_sym}.
